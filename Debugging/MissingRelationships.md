# Missing Relationships in Power BI

This document highlights some common scenarios where relationships may be missing in Power BI, leading to incorrect data models or calculations. Understanding and fixing missing relationships is crucial for accurate reporting and analysis.

---

## 1. **Missing Relationships Between Fact and Dimension Tables**

**Scenario**: A fact table (e.g., Sales) is not properly related to the relevant dimension table (e.g., Product or Date), causing aggregation or filter issues.

**Solution**: 
- Ensure that the fact table has appropriate foreign keys that link to the primary keys of dimension tables.
- Check for missing relationships in the **Model View**.
- Create or verify relationships between tables (e.g., `Sales[ProductID]` â†’ `Product[ProductID]`).

```DAX
Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Amount])
```

## 2. **Ambiguous Relationships (Circular Dependency)**

**Scenario**: Multiple tables are related in a way that creates a circular dependency, which causes Power BI to be unable to compute measures correctly.

**Solution**: 
- Identify and remove any redundant relationships that form a loop between tables.
- Use inactive relationships where necessary and activate them with USERELATIONSHIP() if needed.


```DAX
Total Sales = 
CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), USERELATIONSHIP(Sales[ProductID], Product[ProductID]))
```

Here you basically tell Power BI which relationship to explicitly use


## 3. **Inactive Relationships Not Activated**

**Scenario**: A relationship is created but set as inactive by default. Inactive relationships can lead to unexpected results when not properly activated in DAX formulas.

**Solution**: 
- Use USERELATIONSHIP() in your DAX expressions to activate the relationship only when needed.

```DAX
Sales by Date = 
CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), USERELATIONSHIP(Sales[DateKey], Date[DateKey]))
```
## 4. **No Relationship Between Lookup Tables and Fact Tables**

**Scenario**: Lookup tables (e.g., Customer, Product) are not related to the fact tables (e.g., Sales, Orders), which leads to data inconsistencies when trying to filter or aggregate data.

**Solution**: 
- Ensure there is a relationship defined between the lookup tables and the fact tables using the appropriate foreign and primary key.

```DAX
Customer Sales = 
CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), Sales[CustomerID] = Customer[CustomerID])
```
## 5. **Missing Relationship with Time Dimension**

**Scenario**: A time dimension (e.g., Date table) is missing a relationship to the fact table, which causes issues when trying to analyze data by time (e.g., months, years).

**Solution**: 
- Create a relationship between the time dimension and the fact table. Ensure the time column in the fact table has a corresponding date key.

```DAX
Sales by Year = 
CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), YEAR(Sales[Date]) = YEAR(Date[Date]))
```
## 6. **Multiple Relationships and Filter Propagation Issues**

**Scenario**: When two tables have multiple relationships, Power BI may not know which relationship to use for filtering, leading to inconsistent filter propagation.

**Solution**: 
- Set one relationship as active (usually the most relevant) and the others as inactive.
- Use USERELATIONSHIP() for special cases where you need to activate a different relationship temporarily.

```DAX
Active Sales = 
CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), USERELATIONSHIP(Sales[StoreID], Store[StoreID]))
```

## 7. **Relationship Between Tables in Different Schema**

**Scenario**: A relationship is missing between two tables in different schemas, causing confusion in the data model when trying to reference both.

**Solution**: 
- Ensure that the relationship between tables from different schemas is established using the correct column keys and maintain consistency in naming conventions.

```DAX
Sales in Region = 
CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), Region[RegionID] = Sales[RegionID])
```

## 8. **Relationship with Incorrect Cardinality**

**Scenario**: Using an incorrect cardinality type (e.g., One-to-Many vs. Many-to-One) can cause data mismatches or missing data in the reports.

**Solution**: 
- Review the relationships to ensure that the correct cardinality is set based on the nature of the data (e.g., One-to-Many for dimension-to-fact relationships).
- Adjust cardinality if necessary by editing the relationship in the Model View.

```DAX
Sales by Category = 
SUMX(
    FILTER(
        Sales,
        RELATED(Product[Category]) = "Electronics"
    ), 
    Sales[Amount]
)
```

## Key Takeaways
**Verify relationships:** Always double-check that your fact tables and dimension tables are connected.
**Understand cardinality:** Use the correct cardinality (One-to-Many, Many-to-One, etc.) to avoid data issues.
**Use USERELATIONSHIP for inactive relationships:** This allows for more control over the relationships used in specific calculations.
Handle circular references carefully: Avoid circular dependencies, or break them with USERELATIONSHIP and other DAX tricks.
